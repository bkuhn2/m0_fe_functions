# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

*an area i'm working on, but it is improving; having deadlines and knowing what i need to getn done in a day really helps and knowing what is important and and what is not are what help me, and just checking in with myself periodically*

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?

*in the world of javascript, you can create a phrase that commands the computer to do something - you first define what the phrase is and what you want it to do, then you summon or say it and the computer will do it*

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.

*a parameter is a blank slate, essentially a variable, that specifically lives in the parentheses next to the function name, and may be referenced in the function definition; then the argument is the specific value you assign to those parameters/variables that are in the identical spot (parentheses next to function name) when you call the function*

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?

*what else can a function do besides the codelog stuff we've been doing a lot of?*
